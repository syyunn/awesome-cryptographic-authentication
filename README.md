## Metamask
- as extension

`chrome`

`firefox`

`brave`

## Dapper

## Dictums
Shall disentangle `function` and its embedding `component`. Every functions that is used inside of a component must be maintained in separate file. 

## Compnentized Functinalities

1. login-front: `react`

1-0. style-independent functionalities: implement functionalities from styled-component so that we can inject styles into it afterward and maintains the functionalities in isolated fashion from the style.

1-1. styles: shall not implement component-wise styling. Use `tachyon` for baseline and add addtional to the cdn shipped `tachyon+custom` css.
